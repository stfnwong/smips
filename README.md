# SMIPS
MIPS emulator and binary tools 

## Features
- So far almost none - at the moment development of the assembler, disassembler, and maybe a debugger is still incomplete. The actual chip emulation of a MIPS pipeline will only be implemented after that 

## TODOS
- Finish binary tools
- Write MIPS emulation core
- Do an RTL version, maybe in VHDL.
